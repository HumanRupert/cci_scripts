FDCIV-G,Freedom,"Civil Liberties","Our Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The five categories are inter-related and form a coherent conceptual whole. The condition of holding free and fair competitive elections, and satisfying related aspects of political freedom, is clearly the sine qua non of all definitions.","EIU - Democracy Index",http://www.eiu.com,"Democracy-index-2014.pdf from eiu.com",2014,"The Economist Intelligence Unit?s index of democracy, on a 0 to 10 scale, is based on the ratings for 60 indicators grouped in ve categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. Each category has a rating on a 0 to 10 scale, and the overall index of democracy is the simple average of the ve category indexes. We use a combination of a dichotomous and a three-point scoring system for the 60 indicators. A dichotomous 1-0 scoring system (1 for a yes and 0 for a no answer) is not without problems, but?it has several distinct advantages over more re ned scoring scales (such as the often-used 1-5 or 1-7). For many indicators, the possibility of a 0.5 score is introduced, to capture ?grey areas? where a simple yes (1) of no (0) is problematic, with guidelines as to when that should be used. Thus for many indicators there is a three-point scoring system, which represents a compromise between simple dichotomous scoring and the use of ner scales.  The problems of 1-5 or 1-7 scoring scales are numerous. For most indicators under such a system, it is extremely dif cult to de ne meaningful and comparable criteria or guidelines for each score. This can lead to arbitrary, spurious and non-comparable scorings. ",1,1,1
