TCRIMJ,Trust,"Criminal Justice","measures whether the criminal investigation, adjudication, and correctional systems are effective, and whether the criminal justice system is impartial, free of corruption, free of improper in uence, and protective of due process and the rights of the accused.","World Justice Project",http://worldjusticeproject.org/historical-data,http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/media/wjp_rule_of_law_index_2016.pdf,2015,"The WJP Rule of Law Index 2016 report presents information on eight composite factors that are further disaggregated into 44 specific sub-factors. An outline of these factors and sub-factors begins on the next page. Factor 9, informal justice, is included in the framework, but has been excluded from the aggregated scores and rankings in order to provide meaningful cross-country comparisons. In attempting to present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, each score of the Index is calculated using a large number of questions drawn from two original data sources collected by the World Justice Project in each country: a General Population Poll (GPP) and a series of Qualified Respondents? Questionnaires (QRQs). These two data sources collect up-to-date firsthand information that is not available at the global level, and constitute the world?s most comprehensive dataset of its kind. They capture the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens and in-country professionals concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country. The country scores and rankings presented in this report are built from more than 500 variables drawn from the assessments of more than 110,000 citizens and 2,700 legal experts in 113 countries and jurisdictions, making it the most accurate portrayal of the factors that contribute to shaping the rule of law in a nation.
