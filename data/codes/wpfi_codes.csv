It is a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country. It does not rank public policies even if governments obviously have a major impact on their country?s ranking. Nor is it an indicator of the quality of journalism in each country.","World Press Freedom Index",https://rsf.org/en/news/2016-world-press-freedom-index-leaders-paranoid-about-journalists,https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2016,2016,"The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF.
